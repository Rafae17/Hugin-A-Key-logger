# Hugin-A-Key-logger
Odin was a Norse mythological character.
In the mythology, he is the most powerful.
He rules over Asgard and has two loyal ravens always sitting on his shoulders.
'Hugin' and  'Munin'
Munin represented 'thought'
Hugin represented 'memory'
These two ravens used to travel the world and observed each and everything that's hppening in the world and report it back to Odin.
Now, This tool that I created almost does the same.
It observes each and every character that is pressed on the deployed system and records it in a txt file.
